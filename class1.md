### So what is Markdown? 

Markdown is a language that can be used to add formatting and design to otherwise plain text. The set of editing rules in Markdown allows the user to make common changes such as: **bolding**, *italics*, ~~strikethroughs~~, etc. However a user is not limited to just simple text editing in Markdown, they can also use it to create links within a page and add images or gifs. A way I like to think of it is that Markdown is more user friendly than HTML but harder than Microsoft Word which allows one to edit text with just the click of a button

Markdown is a wonderful tool which allows us to create simple websites, notes, books, etc. 

> ##### History Time: Markdown was created by John Gruber and the late Aaron Swartz in 2004. If you have time, take a look at the history for these two as they both have made interesting contributions in technology. 

### Why use Markdown? 

Instead of Markdown, some of us prefer WYSIWG editors such as HTML or CSS. What is a WYSIWYG editor? Well first what does that unecessarily long abbreviation stand for? WYSIWYG stands for "What You See Is What You Get". In terms of computing/software development, this refers to creation or input of content which will appear similar to the final output or displayed product.
