# Class 01 Reading Notes - *Learning Markdown*

Markdown is our friend, Markdown is our savior...

- Markdown is a language that can be used to add formatting and design to plaintext documents. Markdown is easier than HTML but harder than Microsoft Word which will edit text with just the click of a button
- What is a WYSIWYG editor? Well first what does that unecessarily long abbreviation stand for? WYSIWYF stands for "What You See Is What You Get". In terms of computing/software development, this refers to creation or input of content which will appear similar to the final output or displayed product.
