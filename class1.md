### So what is Markdown?

Markdown is a language that can be used to add formatting and design to otherwise plain text. The set of editing rules in Markdown allows the user to make common changes such as: **bolding**, *italics*, ~~strikethroughs~~, etc. However a user is not limited to just simple text editing in Markdown, they can also use it to create links within a page and add images or gifs. A way I like to think of it is that Markdown is more user friendly than HTML but harder than Microsoft Word which allows one to edit text with just the click of a button. Markdown is a wonderful tool which allows us to create simple websites, notes, books, etc. 

> #### History Time: Markdown was created by John Gruber and the Aaron Swartz (deceased) in 2004. If you have time, take a look at the history for these two as they both have made interesting contributions in technology.

### Why use Markdown? 

Instead of Markdown, some of us prefer WYSIWG editors such as HTML or CSS. What is a WYSIWYG editor? Well first what does that unecessarily long abbreviation stand for? WYSIWYG stands for "What You See Is What You Get". In terms of computing/software development, this refers to creation or input of content which will appear similar to the final output or displayed product.

### Basic Syntax for Markdown

**Headings** - Creating a heading like the one above requires using a `#` followed by your desired text. Between 1-6 hashtags can be used to make a heading larger or smaller respectively. The above heading was created as follows: `### Basic Syntax for Markdown`

**Emphasis** - Creating emphasis requires us to bold, italicize, strikethrough, or use some other combintion. We can bold by adding 2 asterisks before and after a word such as `**word**`, italics require only 1 asterisk such as `*word*`, and a combination of both requires 3 asterisks such as `***word***`
