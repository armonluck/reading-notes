# Class 4 Reading Notes - *Structure web pages with HTML*

## What is HTML?

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)is a markup language used to create the bones, frame, structure, or scaffold of a website.
- HTML is seen on front-end development
- As noted above, HTML is NOT a programming language but is instead a *markup language*

## What are Wireframes? 

- Practice used by UX Designers - low fidelity sketch of digital interface, barebones of a design
- Provides basic artifact that can be tested with users through positioning of buttons and menus on the diagram 
- Mobile app wireframes can be created for each screen in a product/app 
- Types: physical hand drawn sketch vs digital wireframes
- Both types need basic fundamental shapes in black/white/gray. Keep things in basic forms/colors. 
- Digital wireframes can be shared w    ith the rest of the design team.

### Code used to structure a web page and its content.

- HTML consists of a series of **elements** which are used to enclose/wrap different parts of the content and make it appear a certain way
- Enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make font bigger or smaller, and so on 

### Elements: Opening Tag, Content, Closing Tag

- Opening tag: `<p>`, consists of name of element ‘p’ and surrounding brackets
- Content
- Closing tag: `</p>` includes a *forward slash* before the element name. 

### Elements can have ***attributes***

- class=“editor-note” , info about the element that does NOT appear in the actual content. 
- “Class” is attribute name and “editor-note” is the attribute value
- Quote ALL attribute values for consistency- Nesting elements: elements inside of other elements- <strong> used to emphasize words- <p> used to denote a paragraph- Empty elements

> There are elements with NO content or closing tags.
> For example, the `<img>` element
