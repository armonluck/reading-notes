# Class 4 Reading Notes - *Structure web pages with HTML*

## What are Wireframes?

- **Wireframes** are low fidelity sketches of digital interface and are used by UX Designers. Think of them as the barebones of a website design
- This practice provides basic artifacts that can be tested with users through positioning of buttons and menus on the diagram
- Types: physical hand drawn sketches vs digital wireframes
- Both types need basic fundamental shapes in black/white/gray. Keep things in basic forms/colors.

## What is HTML?

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)is a *markup language* used to create the bones, frame, structure, or scaffold of a website and its content.
- HTML is seen on front-end development
- As noted above, HTML is NOT a programming language but is instead a *markup language*

### Code used to structure a web page and its content.

- HTML consists of a series of **elements** which are used to enclose/wrap different parts of the content and change its appearance
- Enclosing tags can turn a word or image into a hyperlink, can change emphasis of words (bold, italics, etc.), can change font size, and more!

### Anatomy of an HTML Element

Lets use the following piece of code as an example:

`<p>My dog is very sleepy</p>`

- Opening tag: `<p>`, consists of the name of element ‘p’ and surrounding brackets. The opnening tag represents where the elements starts to take effect.
- Content: `My dog is very sleepy`, is the content of the element. 
- Closing tag: `</p>` includes a *forward slash* before the element name. 

### Elements can have ***attributes***

- class=“editor-note”, info about the element that does NOT appear in the actual content. 
- “Class” is attribute name and “editor-note” is the attribute value
- Quote ALL attribute values for consistency
- Nesting elements: elements inside of other elements
- `<strong>` used to emphasize words
- `<p>` used to denote a paragraph- Empty elements

> There are elements with NO content or closing tags.
> For example, the `<img>` element.
