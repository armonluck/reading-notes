# Class 5 Reading Notes - *Design web pages with CSS*

## What is CSS?

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a programming language that allows you to design a website. CSS allows us to control, with extreme precision, how HTML elements appear on a webpage.

A document or text file is structured using a markup language such as [HTML](class4.md). Text files are then presented (usually in a visual format) by using internet browsers which can display information on a screen, project something, or print it out.

> Note: Internet browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) are also known as **user agents**.

When we see how basic HTML is read in a web browser we can notice that the text does have design elements applied such as headings being larger and links being blue/underlined. This is because our internet browser's have very basic CSS styles built into them that applies what is written in HTML.

### CSS Syntax

CSS is defined by rules which specifiy what styles should be applied to an elements or groups of elements written by your markup language.

> HTML is the markup language that most people are familiar with, however, there are others such as SVG or XML which can be styled by CSS.

Let's look at an example of CSS being used to style the heading on a page to be displayed as large blue text.

`h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}`
