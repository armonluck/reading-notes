# Class 2 Reading Notes - *The Coder's Computer*

## Choosing A Text Editor

A *text editor* is software that allows you to write and manage text which is primarily used for building websites or applications. There are a myriad of options to choose from similar to how when choosing to buy a computer there are are seemingly endless options to sift through before landing on a decision. 

### **What Features are Important in a Text Editor?**

 1. *Code Completion*
    - This is a feature in some text editors which displays possible suggestions once you begin typing. This feature is similar to how your phone will display word suggestions when typing out a text message. Code completion will also finish closing tags/brackets/quotation marks for a user which is easily forgotten when writing code. VS Code, the text editor, being used in this class is especially helpful because it has Emmet built in which is a plug-in that allows you to type in shorthand and click on possible options which reveal long sections of intended code.

2. *Syntax Highlighting*
    - Highlighting is essential for developers who may be staring at a computer for long stretches. This feature changes the color of text. This allows for you to differentiate bewteen different sections of text and identify errors more easily.

3. *Variety of Color Themes*
    - *Color themes* are similarly important so that text is easier to read and pouring over dense code is less tedious. Web/software developers frequently use dark backgrounds and brightly colored text. It's almost like a scene from ***The Matrix***. ![Coding picture](https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/matrix-code.jpg)

4. *Option to Choose from Extensions When Needed*
    - Adding extensions to a text editor allows for further customization. Some features that can be added include spell checkers, history logs which track changes, bookmarking within code, debugging, and more.
