## Version Control

**Version Control:** a system that allows you to revisit various verions of a file by recording changes. This allows you to revert a file/project to a previous version, track modifications & who made those changes, and compare changes. Using a Version Control System (VCS) mistakes or deleted information is esily fixed and collaboration between multiple people is simplified.

- **Local Version Control:** Outdates system in which a local VCS uses 1 database on your hard disk that stores changes and file data
- **Centralized Version Control (CVCS):** A system which allows for a single server to store all changes and file data which can be accessed by multiple users.
- **Distributed Version Control (DVCS):** This system addresses the flaw or weak point of a CVS: the server is a single point of failure. If a CVS server crashes, users cannot share work or save new changes. A DCVS fixes this by allowing clients to create *mirrored repositories* or data backups in case of a server error.

### So What is Git?

**Snapshots**: Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of *snapshots*. Each time you save a new version of a project (aka a commit) Git makes a snapshot of this file and references it for future use.

**Local Operations**:
