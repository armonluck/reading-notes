# *Growth Mindset*

Growth Mindset means persevering through difficult challenges even when you may have doubts about your ability. It involves working through the uncomfortable moments because those moments push us. Difficult situations are not the same as *bad* situations and can often feel dramatically different based on your perception or mindset about an event.

***3 Reminders to Help Me Stay in a Growth Mindset:***

- "If you don't attack anxiety, anxiety will attack you."
- Work towards what your ideal self dreams of, not towards what your current self worries about
- Everyone, even a genius or industry expert, starts out knowing nothing
- Consistenty and dedication will always be there to support you, but motivation is fleeting
