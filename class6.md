# Class 6 Reading Notes - *Dynamic web pages with JavaScript*

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a programming or scripting language that adds interactivity to web pages. Examples of this interactivity include interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, text boxes, buttons, etc. It also has uses in non-browser environments such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is NOT equivalent to the Java programming language as both languages have different syntax, semantics, and uses.

- HTML --> Structure/Skeleton
- CSS --> Style/Design
- JS --> Actions/Interactivity

## Intro to JavaScript - Basic output

JavaScript is typically used inside web browsers by adding JS code to the HTML page. The JS code can run in the browser (client-side) as opposed to running on a web server (server-side).

Three Major Parts of "JavaScript":

1. JS language - standard among various environments and various browsers/servers.
2. DOM API - how the language interacts with various parts of a web page while in a given browser.
3. Server API - provided by Node.js or other server-side systems.

### Editor or IDE

Most text editors can be used to write JS

### Embedding or Adding JS to your HTML page

JavaScript can be *embedded* directly inside the HTML file or a line of code can be added to the HTML file which will link to an external JS file.

To embed JS a `<script>` opening tag and a `</script>` closing tag are added with the JavaScript code inserted between the tags.

### JavaScript Output Commands

1. JS command: `alert("text")`
    - Shows a pop-up in the browser with the desired `"text"`
2. JS command: `document.write("<h1>Hellow World</h1>")`
    - Will display/write desired text at a certain location in the file.
3. JS command: `console.log("text")`
    - Allows developers to print out debugging information
    - Most web browsers have a "JavaScript console" which is an additional window that displays errors/warnings generated by executing JS code.
    - To open the console, hit `Command + I` or *inspect* your web page and navigate to the console.

## JavaScript Input w/Prompt & Confirm

1. JS command: `prompt("text", "___")`
    - Shows a pop-up window with text provided as the 1st parameter and a blank textbox which the user can fill in as the 2nd parameter.
2. JS command: `confirm ("text")`
    - The `confirm()` function is not a stand-alone input method and instead allows for a Yes/No or True/False question. A pop window will show with text and two buttons. If the user presses `OK` the `confirm()` function will be `true` and if the user presses `cancel` or hits the `ESC` (escape) key the function will be `false`.
    - `confirm` is usually used with an `if-else` statement in order to provide feedback to the user based on their response.

## JavaScript Variables

**Variables** are labels/containers for storing data or data values and can have different names. An easy way to think of variables is in terms of `x`, `y`, and `z` just like algebra. Additionally, variables can be *declared* in four different ways: using `var`, using `let`, using `const`, and using nothing. A variable can have a declared/defined value or no value (undefined).

For example:

Declaring a variable AND assigning value
> let myName = "Armon"

Declaring a variable with NO value: 
> let backpack;

### Using `var`

The `var` keyword was used in ALL JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. Keywords `let` and `const` were added to JS in 2015 and are recommended when declaring variables today. In order for code to run on older browsers, developers must use `var`.

### Using `const` or `let`

If a variable is constant and will or should NEVER change then use `const`. However, if variables are subject to change then declare them with `let`.

### JavaScript identifiers

All JS variables must be labeled with unique names or **identifiers**. Identifiers can be short (like a and b) or more descriptive (age, product, usersCollegeMajor). The rules for making unique identifiers are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names should begin with a letter
- Names can also begin with $ and _
- Names are case sensitive **(`Name` and `name` are different variables)**
- Reserved words such as JS keywords (`var`) cannot be used as names

### Types of Data

1. Strings --> Text
    - `'Your text goes here'`
2. Numbers --> No quotation marks
    - `42; -5; 0.27`
3. Boolean --> Logic
    - `True`
    - `False`

### Binary & Data

- Input: Telling a computer what to do.
- Storage: Info that is stored in a computer's memory
- Processing: A computer takes an input, runs an algorithm, and then produces an output
- Output: Depends on what a computer is designed to do.

### Circuits & Logic

- Binary: a series of 1's and 0's which represent information to a computer
- Bit: Smallest piece of information a computer can store. Represents a 1 or 0, True or False, and On or Off respectively.
- Sound in Binary: Sound can be represented by a waveform with data points assigned which represent numbers on a graph.

### CPU, Memory, Input, & Output

- Circuits: A simple circuit takes an electrical signal (1 or 0) and flips it. A complicated circuit takes multiple signals and produces multiple outputs.
- The smaller the circuit, the faster an electrical signal travels and performs a calculation.

### Hardware & Software

- Input, Store, Process, and Output
- Input Devices: Keyboard, touchpad, microphone, etc.
- CPU: A keyboard converts a letter to numbers...
- Output Devices: Screen/monitor, speakers, 3D printers, etc.
