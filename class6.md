#### Binary & Data

- Input: Telling a computer what to do. 
- Storage: Info that is stored in a computer's memory
- Processing: A computer takes an input, runs an algorithm, and then produces an output
- Output: Depends on what a computer is designed to do. 


#### Circuits & Logic

- Binary: a series of 1's and 0's which represents information to a computer
- Bit: Smallest piece of information a computer can store. Represents a 1 or 0, True or False, and On or Off respectively.
- Sound in Binary: Sound can be represented by a waveform with data points assigned which represent numbers on a graph.

#### CPU, Memory, Input, & Output

- Circuits: A simple circuit takes an electrical signal (1 or 0) and flips it. A complicated circuit takes multiple signals and produces multiple outputs. 
- The smaller the circuit, the faster an electrical signal travels and performs a calculation.

#### Hardware & Software

- Input, Store, Process, and Output
- Input Devices: Keyboard, touchpad, microphone, etc. 
- CPU: A keyboard converts a letter to numbers...
- Output Devices: Screen/monitor, speakers, 3D printers, etc.
