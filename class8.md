# Class 8 Notes - *Operators and Loops*

## Expressions and Operators

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. All complex expressions are joined by *operators*. There are two (2) types of expressions: those with side effects (like assigning values) and those that only *evaluate*.

1. Expression: `x = 7`
    - Expression uses the `=` operator to assign a value of `7` to the variable `x`.
2. Expression: `3 + 4`
    - Expression ONLY evaluates this addition problem. It is NOT part of a bigger construct, there is no variable declaration, and results will be immediately discarded.
    - Usually a programmer **mistake** because the evaluation does NOT produce any effects.

The *precedence* of operators determines the order that they are applied when evaluating an expression. Arithmetic operators seem to follow normal order of operations learned in introductory math classes. For a complete table of operator precedence and exceptions to the rules please refer to the [Operator Precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table) page.

### Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of the right operand. A simple assignment operator is `=` which assigns the value of its right operand to the left operand. To explain, in the expression `x = f()`, the value of `f()` is assigned to `x`. There are also **compound assignment operators** which are shorthand for mathematic operations. 

### Comparison Operators

A comparison operator compares operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is "true".

## Loops

Loops are functions that provide a quicky and easy way to perform an action repeatedly. There are many types of loops, but they all have a similar function: repeat an action some 'i' number of times (the number could be 0 or infinity)

### *for* Loops

A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. Useful when the programmer knows or expects how many steps/actions will be needed. 

> Structure: `for`

`for(initial value; condition to evaluate; increment){code to execute}`

> Example 1

`for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++){
    console.log(i);
    }`

Initial Value | Logic Evaluation | Code to Execute | Next Value
--- | --- | --- | ---
i = 0 | 0<5? True| console.log 0 | i is 1
i = 1 | 1<5? True | console.log 1 | i is 2
i = 2 | 2<3? True | console.log 2 | i is 3
i = 3 | 3<3? False | BREAK LOOP | N/A

> Example 2

`function rateMyPage(){
    let rating = prompt("How many starts would you rate my page?");
    for (let i = 0; i < rating; i++){
        document.write("STAR");}`

### *while* Loops

Used when we donâ€™t know how long something will take or how many loops we want. A `while` statement is executed as long as a condition evaluates to `true`.

> Structure: `while`

`while (condition to evaluate is true){execute this code}`

`console.log(!false);` = not false = true
`console.log(!true);` = not true = false

> Loop will continue until input is "yellow"

`let response = prompt("What is my favorite color?");
while (response !== 'yellow'){response = prompt("Wrong, guess again");
}`

`console.log("Congrats, you guessed it!");`

> Example of self limiting loop

`let x = 0;
while(x < 100){
    console.log(x);
    x++;}`
